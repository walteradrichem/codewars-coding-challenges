# Count Change

Write a function that counts how many different ways you can make change for an amount of money, given an array of coin denominations. Must return back an integer with the number of combinations.

## Example

There are 3 ways to give change for 4 if you have coins with denomination 1 and 2:

```
1+1+1+1, 1+1+2, 2+2.
```

The order of coins does not matter:

```
1+1+2 == 2+1+1
```
